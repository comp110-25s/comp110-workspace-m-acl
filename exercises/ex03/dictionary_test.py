# import pytest

# from exercises.ex03.dictionary import invert, favorite_color, count, bin_len
# from exercises.ex03.dictionary import invert


# Also inside the exercises/ex03 directory, create a file named dictionary_test.py. Add
# a docstring and establish an __author__ in this file as well.

# For each function from below (invert, count, favorite_color, bin_len), you are to
#
#  define at least 3x unit test functions. Remember that a unit test function
# starts with test_.

# The 3 unit tests should consist of:

# One edge case
# Two use cases
# Include descriptive function names and docstrings, so that it captures
#  what is being tested.

# python -m pytest exercises/ex03
